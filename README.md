IVF is safe but like any treatment, there are some risks. Common side effects include bloating, mood swings, headache, and mild pain during injections. These happen due to hormone medicines and usually go away after treatment.

A few people may get OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome) where ovaries swell and fluid collects. It's rare, but if you feel very bloated or can't breathe properly, doctor must be informed.

Multiple pregnancies (twins/triplets) can happen if more embryos are transferred. It can be risky during delivery. Thatâ€™s why many clinics now transfer only 1 or 2 embryos.

Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or failed cycles are emotional risks too. Thatâ€™s why emotional support and counselling is important in IVF journey.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre, they explain all risks before starting and follow proper guidelines. The team supports you emotionally also, which is very needed.
